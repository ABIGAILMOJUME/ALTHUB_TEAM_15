## Project Overview - React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template]
(https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Branch Protection Rules

To enforce workflow integrity:

-   âœ… **Direct push to `main` and `dev` is disabled**
    
-   âœ… **PR approval required (at least 1 reviewer)**
    
-   âœ… **Status checks must pass before merging**
    
-   âœ… **Linear history enforced (no merge commits)**


## Commit Standards

Follow Conventional Commit Messages:

```bash
feat: add user login functionality
fix: resolve crash on product page
docs: update README with setup instructions
```

## Housekeeping

-   Delete merged branches after PR is merged.
    
-   Rebase (not merge) if conflicts exist in your branch:
    
	```bash
	 git fetch origin
	 git rebase origin/dev` # this is an example 
	```
